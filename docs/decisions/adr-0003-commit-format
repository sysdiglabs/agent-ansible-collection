# ADR-0003 - Commit Messages Formatting

## Feature
N/A

## Status
Reviewing

## Context
Pull request titles and commit messages serve as vital references
 to past developments, aiding future engineers in comprehending
 the code, design and decisions, and in streamlining both the 
 development cycles as well as the debugging processes.

## Decision
* For every commit, the commit message should include a type and scope. Check [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for example: 'feat(host): add the agent installation support for AL2023'.
* Every pull request title must also respect the conventional commit rules so that a meaningful changelog will be automatically generated.
